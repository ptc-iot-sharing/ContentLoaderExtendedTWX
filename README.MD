# Content Loader Extended

Extension to improve how ThingWorx can consume external REST APIs, adding functionality missing from
the OOTB `Resources.ContentLoaderFunctions`.

## Usage

The extension exposes a new ThingWorx Resource called `ContentLoaderExtended`.

The core service this exposes is `ExecuteHttpRequest`. This service can be used to execute a request
of any type to a server. The HTTP verb can be specified using a service parameter.

Here are the parameters the service accepts:

Usage examples:

- Executing a GET request:

```javascript
let result = Resources.ContentLoaderExtended.ExecuteHttpRequest(
    {
      url: url,
      withResponseStatus: true,
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        Prefer: "odata.maxpagesize=100",
        Accept: "application/json;odata.metadata=full",
      },
      ignoreSSLErrors: true,
      password: "test",
      username: "test"
    },
);
```

- Executing a PATCH request with body and mutual SSL auth:

```javascript
let result = Resources.ContentLoaderExtended.ExecuteHttpRequest(
    {
      url: url,
      withResponseStatus: true,
      method: "PATCH",
      contentType: "application/json",
      content: JSON.stringify({prop: "Value"}),
      headers: {
        ContentType: "application/json",
        CSRF_NONCE: me.csrfNonce,
      },
      ignoreSSLErrors: true,
      trustStorePassword: "***",
      keyStorePassword: "***",
      trustStorePath: "absoute path to file on disk",
      keyStorePath: "absoute path to file on disk "
    },
);
```

- Executing multiple requests in parallel

```javascript
// Execute multiple requests simultaneously by executing in a separate thread for each request.
// This approach is much faster than calling multiple 'ExecuteHttpRequest()' in a row,
// since each request blocks the execution of the script.
let result = Resources.ContentLoaderExtended.ExecuteHttpRequests({
  array: [
    {
      url: url1,
      method: 'GET',
    },
    {
      url: url2,
      method: 'GET',
    },
    {
      url: 'invalid ⚠️',
      method: 'GET',
    }
  ]
});

// Array of all results (in this example there are three result objects)
let allResults = result.array;

// Array of all (fulfilled) responses. Each object's structure is exactly the same as that of 'ExecuteHttpRequest'.
let responses = result.array.filter((e) => !e.error);

// In case of an error ('ExecuteHttpRequest' would throw an error), an object with the property "error" of
// type "string" is returned, which describes the error. In this example, they are simply logged.
result.array.filter((e) => e.error).forEach((e) => logger.error(e.error));
```

- Sending a Multipart request with multiple files in the body:

```javascript
let files = DataShapes.MultipartFile_DS.CreateValues();
files.AddRow({
  multipartFileName: "Name of multipart file",
  repository: "ThingName of the FileRepository thing where the file is stored",
  pathOnRepository: "path to the file in the file repository",
});
let bodyParts = Resources.InfoTableFunctions.CreateInfoTable();
bodyParts.AddField({name: "PART_NAME", baseType: "STRING"});
bodyParts.AddField({name: "SECOND_PART_NAME", baseType: "STRING"});
bodyParts.AddRow({
  PART_NAME: "PART1_VALUE",
  SECOND_PART_NAME: "PART2_VALUE",
});
let result = Resources.ContentLoaderExtended.ExecuteHttpMultipartRequest(
    {
      url: url,
      method: "POST",
      filesToSend: multipartFiles,
      partsToSend: multipartParts,
      ignoreSSLErrors: true,
      password: "test",
      username: "test"
    }
);
```

## Development

After cloning the repository, please add the following files into `lib/common`. These files can be
obtained from the ThingWorx installation directory,
in `/apache-tomcat/webapps/Thingworx/WEB-INF/lib`.
The version numbers listed below should serve as just a recommendation, as the actual file versions
found in the ThingWorx installation directory might be different.

* `json-20171018.jar`
* `thingworx-common-9.2.3-b189.jar`
* `thingworx-platform-common-9.2.3-b189.jar`
* `joda-time-2.9.jar`
* `slf4j-api-1.7.12.jar`
* `logback-core-1.0.13.jar`
* `logback-classic-1.0.13.jar`

The folder layout can be modified by editing the project.ext section in the build.gradle file. The
default layout is as following:

```gradle
	uiDir = "/ui" // if there are any widgets
	localJarDir = "/lib/local" // if you have any local jars that need to be included in the project, add them here
	srcDir = "${baseDir}/src/main" // where are the sources located
	buildDir = "${baseDir}/build" // where is the build saved
	configDir = "${baseDir}/configfiles" // folder location of the metadata.xml file
	entitiesDir = "${baseDir}/configfiles/Entities" // folder location Entities that are included with the extension
	zipDir = "${baseDir}/zip" // where to store the generated zip 
	thingworxSdkDir = "${baseDir}/lib/twxSdk" // where the thingworx sdk is located
```

The thingworx related gradle tasks are:

* `packageExtension`: creates in the zipDir an zip archive with the extension
* `upload`: uploads the extension to the specified TWX server.
